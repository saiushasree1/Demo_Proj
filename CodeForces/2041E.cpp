/*The provided C++ code is a solution to a problem on Codeforces (problem 2041/E).
It reads two integer inputs, `a` and `b`. The code then outputs the number 3, followed by three numbers on a new line. 
These three numbers are calculated based on `a` and `b` as follows: `b`, `b`, and `3*a - 2*b`. 
The program's output structure suggests it's likely providing coordinates or values related to a geometric or mathematical problem where three points or values are required as the solution. 
The problem link points to a contest problem, indicating this is a competitive programming solution where efficiency and correctness in output format are crucial.*/
